The following errors were giving compile time error:

1) In line 32: sum = sum[i] + Array[i];
Here sum is an integer but it is being called as an array. The correct code would be: sum = sum + Array[i];


The following code were giving logical errors:

1) Incorrect: scanf("%d", array_size);
Correct: scanf("%d", &array_size);

2) Incorrect: if (array_size>0)
Correct: if (array_size<0)

3) Incorrect: Correct: Array = malloc(sizeof(int) );
 Check = malloc(sizeof(int)); 
Correct: Array = malloc(sizeof(int) * array_size);
 Check = malloc(sizeof(int) * array_size);
